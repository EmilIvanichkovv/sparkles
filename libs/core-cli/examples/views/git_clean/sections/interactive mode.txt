When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the files and directories to be cleaned, and goes into
its interactive command loop.

The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a prompt "What now> ". In general, when the
prompt ends with a single >, you can pick only one of the choices given and type return, like this:

        *** Commands ***
            1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers
            4: ask each             5: quit                 6: help
        What now> 1

You also could say c or clean above as long as the choice is unique.

The main command loop has 6 subcommands.

clean
    Start cleaning files and directories, and then quit.

filter by pattern
    This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Input ignore patterns>>" prompt. You can
    input space-separated patterns to exclude files and directories from deletion. E.g. "*.c *.h" will excludes
    files end with ".c" and ".h" from deletion. When you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER
    (empty) back to the main menu.

select by numbers
    This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Select items to delete>>" prompt. When the
    prompt ends with double >> like this, you can make more than one selection, concatenated with whitespace or
    comma. Also you can say ranges. E.g. "2-5 7,9" to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list. If the second number in
    a range is omitted, all remaining items are selected. E.g. "7-" to choose 7,8,9 from the list. You can say *
    to choose everything. Also when you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the
    main menu.

ask each
    This will start to clean, and you must confirm one by one in order to delete items. Please note that this
    action is not as efficient as the above two actions.

quit
    This lets you quit without do cleaning.

help
    Show brief usage of interactive git-clean.
